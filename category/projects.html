</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I really like Anarchy Online. There's a bit of an archival subculture in the 
community - it's an old game now, with <em>a lot</em> of history behind it - complete
with a <a href="https://gitlab.com/AOvault/AOvault">community archive</a> that keeps track of everything from CD images to 
screenshots. As I browsed through the files, it had me thinking about what 
would happen when the game went offline - all the unique areas and characters 
and music and everything would be in effect lost. So I opened my hex editor and fired up 
<a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/">IDA</a>. I'm happy to say that since then almost all of the 
assets and their file formats have been reverse engineered and documented, the 
results of which can be seen below. I decided to call this project Leet, 
after a fan favourite character in the game.</p>
<p><a href="/data/leet.mp4">An equiped character, showing off some new armour</a></p>
<p><a href="/data/leet2.mp4">The new Aztur model for the RK2019 server</a></p>
<p>After figuring out most of the assets, it occured to me how cool it would be to
put together an interactive demo. If anything, it would give me a chance
to put MiST, a library that I wrote in C, containing wealth of neat things, 
including a thread module that implements something akin to C# style tasks - 
to good use! You can see the results of that effort here:</p>
<p><a href="/data/orange.mp4">Running around</a></p>
<p><a href="/data/orange2.mp4">Showing off some camera controls</a></p>
<p>It was quite an effort putting it all together. In order to just playback the 
animations alone I had to write a whole new animation system from the ground up, but
the results are quite good I feel, given it supports a modern feature set. Indeed, 
the whole project runs on wholly original technology, from graphics down to 
the configuration parser. I initially toyed with the idea of reading all of 
the assets from the game's resource database, but opted against it, reasoning 
that it would be better to preprocess all of the assets into original new formats, 
both out of concern for Anarchy Online, and to make implementing the 
new systems easier. I ended up calling this new effort Orange to set it apart
from Leet proper.</p>
<p>It was all in all very worth while, being full of new experiences and interesting
stories to tell.</p>                </article>
