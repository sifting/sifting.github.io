</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I love a good <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a>, in particular <a href="https://www.play.net/dr/">Dragon Realms</a>. 
The depth and potential for immersive  experiences in these games cannot be overstated.
So it was, more or less on a whim, that I ended up playing around with the idea of 
writing my own. While there is a glut of high fantasy MUDs, there are, to my knowledge
no science fiction ones.</p>
<p>The game runs in a browser and uses <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455">websockets</a>. The server was written in D,
and as there were no websocket hosts for <a href="https://dlang.org/">D</a> at the that time, or indeed, at all,
I had to write my own implementation! The game logic itself is all done in Lua.</p>
<p>We found right away in test playing that this little project has something
special. All players start with a randomly generated character, and must struggle
to establish and maintain themselves in a ruthless byzantine dystopia. I look
forward to sharing this one!</p>

<p>Welcome to the premier transhumanist MUD of the 21st century.</p>
<p>You are Arline Ritter, a svelte woman with short auburn hair</p>
<p>You stand 163cm tall and weigh 52kg</p>
<p>The Commons</p>
<p>The sound of unseen wind chimes lend a meditative quality to the atmosphere of this place. Sleek white plastics define its walls, and pockets of modern seating are arranged throughout the room in an agreeable fashion. Water runs down a beautiful crystaline feature as people come and go. There are others here.</p>
